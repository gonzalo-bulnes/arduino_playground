Characteristic of a Sharp GP2Y0A02YK sensor attached to an Arduino UNO board.

Power supply: the Arduino is powered by its USB connection, the sensor is connected to the Arduino 5V power pin.
Measurements: raw_output is read from the Arduino analog input pin, V_o is measured with a mutimeter. Note that the calibre of the multimeter was changed at 120cm to increase precision, and that the V_o data is provided for reference only (the Arduino readings are though to be more reliable that the multimeter ones).
